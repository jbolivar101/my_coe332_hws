# Python Refresher
## Overview
After many years of not using python, one must jog their memory to grasp the concept once more or learn basic syntax that is now forgotten. Working through simple python code to create functions that can produce the most low level abilities is an easy way to re-integrate into "lifestyle."
## Scripts
This file contains the explanation for the code in this homework folder,
in the odd or even program I check if the number is divisible by 2 then it is 
sorted based on whether or not it can be divided by 2. The second file of prime 
numbers first creates a list of number 3-100, then checks if the number can be divided
by any number below it that is not 1 this then sorts it into prime or not.
## Instructions
In order to run these scripts we must utilize the python application that should be installed into your shell and exexecute the files individually and by name, such as:
```BASH
python3 Odd_Even.py

python3 Prime.py
```
The scripts are meant to print out the data in a simple manner to it can be read by any user, the output should respecitvely read out as:
```BASH
s odd
21 is odd
43 is odd
2 is even
72 is even
53 is odd
54 is even
13 is odd

```
