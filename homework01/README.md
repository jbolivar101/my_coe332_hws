This file contains the explanation for the code in this homework folder,
in the odd or even program I check if the number is divisible by 2 then it is 
sorted based on whether or not it can be divided by 2. The second file of prime 
numbers first creates a list of number 3-100, then checks if the number can be divided
by any number below it that is not 1 this then sorts it into prime or not.
