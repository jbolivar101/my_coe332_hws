Meteorite landing generator and time calculator

Project Description
The folder contains three files that work together in unison in order to first generate the landing sites, then the actual list,
and lastly calculate the time spent on each crater and traveling. This can be applied in the real world with non randomized values,
but instead real data from any planet as long as we have its radius.

Scripts
The scripts use random number generation and json to organize the longitudes and latitudes into lists, which are then transferred into
the json file and retrived in the calculation script. Here I input my values into the function provided by the professor and check the
composition of the meteorite. This iterates and prints the information until it reaches the end of the list and provides a total.

Instructions
To run this code first the generation script must be executed to create the json file, this then allows the calculation script to be
executed and provide the results. The output counts the number of journeys, time spent traveling, and time spent sampling, lastly
outputting the total amount of time the rover was working.
